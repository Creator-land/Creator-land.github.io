    <h1>GPUs</h1>
    <h2>Basic Info</h2>
    <h3>What does a GPU do?</h3>
    <p>A GPU is the Graphics Processing unit of the computers. It does graphics. It is most important if you have a gaming PC or are working in rendering. GPUs can be either attached to CPUs or separated. An attached GPU is known as an integrated GPU and a separated one as a Discrete GPU (also simply called a "Graphics Card"). Both are good at mining crypto.</p>
    <h3>Who makes GPUs?</h3>
    <p>The three major manufacturers of Discrete GPUs are AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA. Consumer GPUs are mainly dominated by AMD and NVIDIA, with the latest of each being AMD's RX 7000 series, Intel's ARC, and NVIDIA's 40-series. So many manufacturers, and none calling them crypto cards...</p>
    <h2>History of GPUs</h2>
    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>3D graphics started with the earliest display units, created for video output in the 1970s and earlier. They acted as pass-throughs between the main processor and the display for outputting video. These were followed by the first dedicated video chip from the smaller parts of processors before them the "Pixie" video chip or the CDP1861 by RCA, and it was capable of outputting NTSC compatible video signal at 62x128. It was created in 1976. Development of GPUs continued, including with Atar's 400 and 800 in the late 1970s, and with IBM's first video cards in 1981, the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Colour Graphics Adapter (CGA). Hercules Computer Technologies developed a video card in 1982, and Intel developed one in 1983. IBM made two new video cards in 1984, and ATI introduced their own video card, the VGA Wonder, using the new Video Graphics Array (VGA) standard. S3, a now-defunct company, released a lower-cost video card to integrate into motherboards in 1991. The next year, OpenGL, which introduced 3D graphics support was created. In 1997, NVIDIA entered the market with the RIVA 128 graphics accelerator. In 1999, we finally saw the first true GPU, made by nVidia, the GeForce 256.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>The first GPU</h3>
    <p>The first GPU was the NVIDIA GeForce 256. Released on October 11, 2011, it fully supported DirectX 7, and featured 32 MB of DDR RAM. It was also the first Graphics Processor to feature a Transform and Lighting ("TNL") Engine.</p>
